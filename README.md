# Invoice
The invoice app is a user-friendly web app for creating and generating invoices. 

The invoice app is a simple web application that allows users to create and generate invoices. Users can add invoice items with product names, quantities, and prices, which are then displayed in a list. The app calculates the total amount for all the items added, and provides options to apply discounts and GST (Goods and Services Tax) to the total amount. Users can then generate an invoice summary, which includes the total amount, discount amount, GST amount, and the grand total. The app also provides a clear interface to reset the form and start a new invoice.
